# ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for location metadata v 1.0.0

## About the reporting format
The ESS-DIVE locations metadata reporting format is intended to guide users in providing a minimal set of guidelines for reporting metadata about point locations.

The reporting format was developed by synthesizing the existing requirements about locations for ESS-DIVEâ€™s [domain-specific reporting formats](https://github.com/ess-dive-community). We also took into consideration other locations-related standards, conventions, guidelines, and reporting formats which you can see in our metadata crosswalk **add link**.

## Quickstart Guide
  1. **Read** brief instructions for using our metadata reporting format.
  2. **Download templates** here.
  3. **Save** your filled-out locations metadata template as a .CSV file.
  4. **Upload** your metadata template along with the rest of your dataset to ESS-DIVE.
    
## How to contribute
This reporting format is intended to be a dynamic format that is responsive to user feedback. We encourage those interested to offer suggestions to the reporting format by submitting a GitHub issue using one of our templates here.

As always, you can always submit suggestions to us via ESS-DIVE's support email address: ess-dive-support *at* lbl.gov
